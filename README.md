# CSharp "C#" GLFW Wrapper:
A simple C# wrapper for GLFW Specification version (3.3.7).

To use it, simply include the class file in your project and make sure to point the string constant (libraryPath) inside that class to the right location of the GLFW DLL.

The Dll can be found at (https://www.glfw.org/download.html) pre-compiled binaries section, note that you can compile the C++ project yourself.

For more information on how to use the GLFW library, go to the following address: (https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/intro_guide.html)
